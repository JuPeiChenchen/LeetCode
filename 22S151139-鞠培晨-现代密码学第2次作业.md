**CBC mode**： Let $A$ be an adversary who outputs a pair of messages $m_0 = 0^n$ and $m_1 = 1^n$, and receives a challenge ciphertext $⟨IV, c⟩$. For CBC encryption, we have that  $c = F_k(IV ⊕mb)$. Adversary $A$ then asks for a decryption of ciphertext $⟨0^n, c⟩$. (Note that $IV \neq 0^n$ except with negligible probability.) The result that A receives back is Private-Key Encryption $ m′ = F^k (c) ⊕0^n$. Given this, A computes $m′ ⊕IV $ which must equal either $m_0$ or $m_1$. Thus, $A$ knows which plaintext was encrypted.

**OFB mode**.：Let A be an adversary who outputs a pair of messages $m_0 = 0^n$ and $m_1 = 1^n$, and receives a challenge ciphertext $⟨IV, c⟩$.
For OFB encryption we have that $c = F_k(IV ) ⊕ mb$. Adversary $A$ then asks for a decryption of ciphertext $⟨IV, 0^n⟩$. (Note that $c \neq 0^n$
except with negligible probability.) The result that A receives back is $m′ = F_k(IV ) ⊕0^n$. Given this, A computes $c ⊕m′ $ which must equal
either $m_0$ or $m_1$. Thus, A knows which plaintext was encrypted.

**CTR mode**： The solution is similar to the solution for OFB mode.

Decryption is computed by first computing $F_k^{-1} (c) $and then outputting the $n/2$ least significant bits of the result. We now show that this scheme is CPA-secure. In order to show this, we first consider an encryption scheme  $\tilde{Π} $ that is identical to the above encryption scheme, except that a truly random permutation is used instead of a pseudorandom one. Let $A$ be an adversary and let $q(·)$ be a polynomial upper-bounding the running-time of $A$. We claim that:
$$
Pr[Privk^{cpa}_{A,\tilde{Π}}(n)=1]\leq \frac{1}{2} +\frac{q(n)}{2^{n/2}}
$$
Let $r_c$ denote the random string used to generate the challenge ciphertext $c = F_k(r∥m)$.There are two cases:

1. The value $r_c$ is used by the encryption oracle to answer at leastone of $A’ s$ queries: In this case, $A$ can know which message was encrypted, but the probability of this event occurring is upper-bound by $q(n)/2^{n/2}$ (this is obtained by applying the union bound).
2.  The value  $ r_c$ is not used by the encryption oracle to answer any of $A’s$ queries: In this case, $A$ learns nothing about the plaintext because the challenge ciphertext is a uniform string (subject to being distinct from all other ciphertexts).

Using a similar argument as in the proof of Theorem 3.31 the above equation follows. The rest of the proof follows as in the proof of Theorem 3.31 by showing that the difference when using a pseudorandom permutation instead is at most negligible.

Assume that $t(n) = c\;log n$ for some constant $c$. Then, consider an adversary $A$ who upon input $1^n$ just outputs an arbitrary $m$ and a uniform $t ∈\{0, 1\}^{t(n)}$ q	. Adversary $A$ succeeds with probability at least $2^{−t(n)}$ since there must be some valid tag for m (note also that $m /∈Q$ always for this $A$). Since $t(n) = c \;log n$ we have that $2^{−t(n)} = n^{−c}$ which is not negligible

**（a）**

Let $m_1, m_2 ∈ \{0, 1\}^n$ be distinct. Then, the tag on the message $m_1, m_2$ is identical to the tag on $m_2, m_1$. Thus, an adversary $A$ can ask for a tag on $m_1, m_2$ and output the message $m_2, m_1$ together with the tag it received.

**（b）**

 Let $m_1, m^′_1, m_2, m^′_2 ∈ \{0, 1\}^{n/2}$ with m1 ̸= m′1 and $m_2 \neq m^′_2$.The attacker obtains tag $t_1$ on the message $m_1, m_2$; tag $t_2$ on the message $m_1, m^′_2$; and tag $t_3$ on the message $m^′_1$, $m_2$. One can then verify that $t_1 ⊕t_2 ⊕t_3$ is a valid tag on $m^′_1, m^′_2$

**（c）**

Let $m_1 ∈\{0, 1\}^{n/2}$ be arbitrary. The attacker can set$ r := ⟨1⟩∥m1$ and output the forgery $⟨r, 0^n⟩$ on the message $m_1$

Yes. Let $ x, x^′$ be a collision for $\hat{H}$; that is, $H^s(H^s(x)) =H^s(H^s(x^′))$. There are two cases:

**（a）**

$H^s(x) = H^s(x^′): $in this case, $x, x^′$ is a collision for the original $H$.Therefore, such a pair can only be found with negligible probability.

**（b）**

$s(x) \neq H^s(x^′):$ set $y = H^s(x)$ and $y^′ = H^s(x^′)$. By the assumption in this case, $y \neq y′$ and yet $H^s(y) = H^s(y^′)$. Thus, $y, y^′$ is a collision in $ H$. Once again, this implies that such a pair $x, x^′$ can be found with only negligible probability (otherwise, by computing $H^s$ once on each one obtains a collision $y, y^′$ in $H^s$.
